                <h4>PLAYABLE CARACTER</h4>
                <h5>Cicero Slater</h5>
                <p>Cicero is a typical college student attending  Miskatonic South Satellite Campus, until a car accident sends him crawling through a thicket in the woods fighting to stay alive. Now he's faced with a choice. Does he let the ancient in the woods sway him and keep himself breathing? Or does he forge through on his own and risk everything he holds dear?</p>

                <h4>NON PLAYABLE CHARACTERS</h4>
                <h5>ERIC JARRET</h5>
                <p>Life for Eric was always such a ...bummer. Everything he has wanted in life has always been handed to someone else. Every effort he exerted only seemed to empower those around him. Now it's his turn, even if he has to take it by force. </p>
