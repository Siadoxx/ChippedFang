                <h5>CICERO SLATER</h5>
                <p>Cicero is a typical college student attending  Miskatonic South Satellite Campus, until a car accident sends him crawling through a thicket in the woods fighting to stay alive. Now he's faced with a choice. Does he let the ancient in the woods sway him and keep himself breathing? Or does he forge through on his own and risk everything he holds dear?</p>

                <p>Life for Eric was always such a ...bummer. Everything he has wanted in life has always been handed to someone else. Every effort he exerted only seemed to empower those around him. Now it's his turn, even if he has to take it by force. </p>

                <p>Lead singer and founder of the Toxic Trixies, she's got a voice like honey and whisky with the spirit to match. Barbara has been dreaming of the band's big break to come, but she could have never imagined what was in store.  </p>

                <p>The two knuckle-head brothers that Barbara can't seem to shake. Lukas being the lead guitar for her band, and Leon being her on again, off again fling that  just doesn't seem to ever go away. </p>
